# Production-managment-app
Application for managing production

This project is a powerful tool for managing production processes and analyzing production results. We create an environment where users can easily control production equipment, track produced products, and monitor production processes.

Within the project, we provide the following functionalities:

1. Equipment and Production Management: Users can select, add, and delete production equipment, as well as the products manufactured on this equipment.

2. Multitasking: The ability to simultaneously start multiple production machines, ensuring efficient process management.

3. Stoppage and Resumption of Production: Users can specify reasons for equipment downtime, choosing the type and subtype of stoppage, and then resume production after downtime.

4. Results Analysis: We provide the capability to analyze data on downtime by product, equipment, and other criteria over different time intervals.

5. Reporting: The ability to generate reports on production processes and results for a selected period.

The project's main page displays information on production results for the current month, allowing users to promptly monitor processes.

The project is in an active development phase, with ongoing expansion of functionality, so users can expect continuous updates and enhancements.
